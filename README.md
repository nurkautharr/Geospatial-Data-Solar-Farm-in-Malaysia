<h1 align="center">Geospatial Data: Solar Farm in Malaysia</h1>

### Skills:
Data preparation, polygon maps visualisation, geospatial analystics, dashboard design, storytelling

### Situation:
Malaysia is committed to transitioning to renewable energy sources, with solar energy playing a crucial role in achieving sustainability targets. However, the expansion of solar panel installations often requires deforestation, which can lead to adverse environmental consequences, including loss of biodiversity, disruption of ecosystems and reduced carbon sequestration.

### Task:
Balancing Solar Panel Development and Forest Conservation for Sustainable Energy Transition in Malaysia.
This project aims to quantify the environmental and economic impact of deforestation for solar panel development in Malaysia and propose a comprehensive compensation framework to ensure the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem
- Visualise polygon maps.
- Calculate polygon area.
- Calculate potential CO2 storage by forest calculation.
- Calculate potential CO2 reduction by generating electricity using solar panel coompared to coal-powered electricity sources.
- Provide insights from the calculation whether sacrifice forest is worth or not for solar farm development.
- Suggest tactical and impactful recommendations for government and private sector for sustainable energy transition.

### Action Performed:
- Developed geospatial data pipelines using Python (GeoPandas, Pandas, Folium) to map and analyse solar farm distributions in Malaysia.
- Delivered actionable insights on sustainable energy transition by quantifying the environmental and economic impacts of deforestation for solar development.
- Performed spatial and statistical analysis of solar irradiation and land-use data, identifying trade-offs between renewable energy expansion and forest conservation.
- Built interactive dashboard to communicate findings on solar energy potential and ecosystem preservation.
